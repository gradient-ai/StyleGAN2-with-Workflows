# StyleGAN2-with-Workflows

Last updated: Oct 01st 2021

This is the repository containing the files required to run the Gradient tutorial *Workflows sample project: StyleGAN2* at https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/tutorials-list/workflows-sample-project-stylegan2 .

The files are two YAML-specified Gradient Workflows, in the `.gradient/workflows` directory, and can be triggered to be run (or rerun) when one's own fork of this repository is updated.

Please refer to the documentation page for more details.
